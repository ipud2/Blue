# Blue
Blue is a game engine written in C++ with the SFML framework, and scripted with lua. 

Currently Blue is a personal project that i work on in my spare time. It still needs a lot of work, and i'm sure what
is completed could still use revision, and more time invested. If you have stumbled accross this project and are interested
in helping, or just have some feedback you would like to share please contact me at anthonydivitto@gmail.com any comments good or bad are welcome. :)
